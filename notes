Booleans
Great! You just stored a number in a variable. Numbers are one data type we use in programming. A second data type is called a boolean.

A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

You can use variables to store booleans like this:



Great work! Now that we know how to store strings, let's see how we can change them using string methods.

String methods let you perform specific tasks for strings.

We'll focus on four string methods:

len()
lower()
upper()
str()


Comparadores

Compare Closely!
Let's start with the simplest aspect of control flow: comparators. There are six:

Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Less than (<)
Less than or equal to (<=)
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Comparators check if a value is (or is not) equal to, greater than (or equal to), or less than (or equal to) another value.

Note that == compares whether two things are equal, and = assigns a value to a variable.

zip to itetare on two list at a time
list_a = [3, 9, 17, 15, 19]
list_b = [2, 4, 8, 10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

for a, b in zip(list_a, list_b):
    # Add your code here!
    if a > b:
        print a
    else:
        print b



create dic from two list
>>> keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> values = [1, 2, 3]
>>> dictionary = dict(zip(keys, values))
>>> print dictionary
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
